# Preface {.unnumbered}

This guide is a resource for data analysts and data scientists looking to improve
the way they write R code. While R remains a popular choice for 
statistical modelling and data analysis, its rapid development has enabled users
to progress their work right through to being deployed into Production. However 
the type of work done when conducting experiments and developing models is very
different to packaging up this work so it can reliably drive decisions in an 
organisation. This book will provide readers with an overview of contemporary
frameworks for how data analysis is done in practice. It will cover how R projects
are usually structured and how this can evolve based on project complexity. It will
examine what is meant by experimental vs production analysis code and which principles
need to be adopted. Finally it will show current tools and frameworks for taking
experimental R code and strengthening it to align with best practice for reliable
production grade software. Readers can step through a case study and download
code to follow along.  

## Who is this for?  

This book is intended as an introductory guide for R users who have experience 
writing code and fitting models, but want to improve their practices for translating
these models into robust code that is reliable and used to make real-world decisions.   

This was initially developed as course materials for various workshops on R code
development and MLOps and its primary purpose was to function as companion materials
to workshop delivery.

will change and evolve over time. I would welcome any early feedback on the content
or new interesting additions.

## Terminology  
Throughout this book the terms 'data science' and 'data analysis' should be 
considered interchangeable and represent the application of advanced data analysis
and statistical techniques to data to achieve an outcome. The word 'analyst' will 
be adopted as the primary role for someone completing these tasks.
